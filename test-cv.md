## About myself

After the graduating the University I was working as an economist. And then as accountant.
This experience and extra studying allowed me to become a Business Analyst in 1C Franchisee.
I have a lot of successful projects. The most known companies I worked with are LLC "Radio Unistar",
LLC "EPAM Systems", LLC "Mobile TeleSystems".

Programming is very interesting to me. I learnt how to program in 1c language. And besides many small tasks, I've developed three big apps for business and for employees.
